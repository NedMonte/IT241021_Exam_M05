# Users not being prompted to save file when closing Notepad in Windows 11

I concluded from the [Official Microsoft Website](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/set-windows-notepad-112307270-to-ask-to-save-upon/b4101233-56b3-4980-a923-2a77a53997a1) 
that Solution related to not being prompted to save a file when closing notepad is the fact that Microsoft didnt include an autosave until some updates later so the only 
question to as the user would be:

- Is your Windows 11 notepad up to date?
