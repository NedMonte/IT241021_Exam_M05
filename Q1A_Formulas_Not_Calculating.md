# Questions to ask
## Based on this [article from Pryor Learning](https://www.pryor.com/blog/why-is-your-excel-formula-not-calculating/) and [this one from ablebits.com](https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/excel-formulas-not-working/), these are the questions to ask the users

Here are some of the questions I would ask to the client:

- Do you have the selected cell formatted as numbers? if its formatted as text values then the formula isnt going to calculate automatically

- Did you write the formula properly? they can get tricky so make sure you didnt miss anything

- Verify that Automatic Recalculation is selected
